<span id="intro">
	Every project has a way to communicate with other developers whether it be IRC, Gitter, or a mailing list. At first you may be nervous to ask  
	or answer a question especially if you aren't very experienced. You may be worried you're going to ask a question that you should know or 
	that you are annoying everyone. It is like the first day of high school; what if they don't like me?, what if I annoy them?, what if they 
	think I'm dumb and look down on me for it?. Forget about all of that this isn't high school, almost everyone is more than happy to help 
	with any question. That being said there is message etiquette that should be followed. Most projects will have a page that goes over their 
	messaging etiquette and it is pretty easy to pick up on just by reading through some other people's messages. I have picked up a few helpful 
	things from my experience.

<h2>Helpful Tips</h2>
	<ul>
	<li> There is always at least one very experienced developer who loves helping 
	<li> Before asking a question do your best to figure out the answer, do as much research on your own as you can
	<li> If you come up empty handed in your research and possibly even more confused then feel free to ask your question
	<li> It isn't necessary to be extremely formal like you are writing a letter to the president, but still be respectful obviously
	<li> Be courteous, don't just jump into the question, start the message with a nice hello then get into the question ("hey everybody" 
		is a completely acceptable start to a message) 
	<li> If it is your first time sending a message it is good to introduce yourself, when starting a project it is good to introduce 
		yourself even if you don't have a question yet
		<ul>
		<li> Something like "Hey everybody, I am new to this project (or open-source) and have a question, 'your question', I'd really appreciate any help"
		<li> Or if you're just introducing yourself "Hey everybody, I've decided to start working on this project and wanted to say hello"
		<li> I know <a HREF="Mifos/Mifos.html" target = "_blank">Mifos</a> encourages people to introduce themselves in their Gitter
		<li> When introducing yourself you don't need to give them your life story, no matter how nice people are nobody really wants to read that 
			unless you are Bill Gates or something but even then everybody probably knows your life story so just don't do it
		</ul> 
	<li> In your message add what you already know so the person answering doesn't have to tell you a bunch of things you know, and you might 
		answer a question someone else has 
	<li> People say there are no dumb questions but trust me there are, if the answer can be found by clicking one of the first few links of a google search  
		don't ask, do some research on your own first 
	<li> Someone will still probably answer the question and nobody will think any less of you but I can't emphasize enough to do some research first, just 
	type it into <a HREF="google.com" target = "_blank">google</a> there's a link right there
	<li> Don't be the person to ask for step-by-step instructions on something simple like how to fork a repository, mess up on a step, and make them restart 
		their instructions, and 30 minutes and 20 something messages later you finally get it, yes I have seen this done, nobody wants to scroll through 
		that many messages and there is a chance someone sent a question in the middle of that and will probably never get an answer because nobody read it
	<li> Be patient after asking a question it can take a while to get a response, don't keep asking 
	</ul>
