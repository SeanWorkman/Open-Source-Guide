<h2>Open-Source Projects</h2>
	<ul>
	<li>Community
		<ul>
		<li> Meritocracy
		<li> As a person makes valuable contributions (not necessarily code) they will be given or take on additional responsibilities 
		<li> A person starts by pointing out a small change then making that change if it is accepted they begin to earn more recognition and progress towards making larger change and eventually become responsible for a portion of the project
		<li> Committer- a developer that is responsible for committing any changes to the code base submitted by others after they have reviewed them
		</ul>
	<br />
	<li> Leadership
		<ul>
		<li> In most projects there is a “Benevolent Dictator” (“BD”) who have final say on decisions, they usually rely on other developers that are high up in the meritocracy to make decisions
		<li> As projects mature and grow they usually switch from BD to a democratic model where decisions are made by consensus
		</ul>
	<br />
	<li> Forking
		<ul>
		<li> The ability for anyone to make their own copy of the code and make changes without affecting the base code
		<li> Example: MariaDB is a fork of MySQL
		</ul>
	<br />
	<li> Communication
		<ul>
		<li> Wikis
		<li> IRC
		<li> Mailing lists
		<li> Bug trackers
		<li> Version control systems
		</ul>
	<br />
	<li> Roadmaps
		<ul>
		<li> Lays out the future of the project
		<li> May be a detailed schedule of bug fixes and enhancements for larger projects or a list of the next enhancements for smaller projects
		</ul>
	<br />
	<li> Repositories
		<ul>
		<li> Where projects save their code and users go to download the software
		</ul>
	<br />
	<li> Packaging
		<ul>
		<li> Projects are distributed as source code meaning it must be downloaded, unzipped, untarred, and then installed using a manual process
		<li> Most projects create a binary package to make it easier to install 
		<li> Pre-configured to be installed without having to build the project from the source code
		</ul>
	<br />
	<li> Upstream/Downstream
		<ul>
		<li> Upstream- the main branch/version
		<li> Downstream- a copy developers work on
		<li> Changes made by developers are pushed upstream to the main branch
		</ul>
	<br />
	<li> Version Control
		<ul>
		<li> Tracks and controls changes made to a project’s files
		</ul>
	<br />
	<li> Trackers
		<ul>
		<li> Bug trackers or Issue trackers are used by most projects to provide a place to find, report, describe, prioritize, reproduce, diagnose, fix and test issues
		</ul>
	<br />
	<li> Workflow
		<ul>
		<li> The method a project uses for getting code from contributors
		<li> Each project is different 
		</ul>
	<br />
	</ul>
