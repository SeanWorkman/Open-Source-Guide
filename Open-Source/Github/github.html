	Github is a website that allows programmers a way to share and contribute code. A project's code is held in repositories, 
	repoos, that are either public or private, free accounts are only capable of having public repos. Most open-source projects 
	use github to store their source code and as an issue tracker.</p>

<span id="gitCommands">
<h2>Git Commands</h2>
	<ul>
	<li> Fetch- <b>git fetch</b> will download the current state (containing updated and newly created branches) of an online repository without modifying your 
		local repository. It places its results in .git/FETCH_HEAD.
	<li> Merge- <b>git merge</b> will merge the modifications of another branch into the current working branch.
	<li> Pull- <b>git pull</b> is a combination of git fetch and git merge. It fetches the information from an online repository's branch and merges it with 
		your local copy.
	<li> Add- Whenever you modify a file in your local repository or create a new file, that file will appear as unstaged. Calling <b>git add</b> allows you to 
		specify files to be added to your staging area.
