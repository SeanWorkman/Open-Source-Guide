<span id="aboutOpenSource" class = "box">
<p>
Open Source software is a rapidly growing option for everyday people that want to develop a program, large companies, and
non-profit organizations, meaning that there is a plethora of options to choose from. Everyone has their own motivation for getting
involved with Open Source. It is a great way to build your resume and skills and it is a great way to give back on a global 
scale instead of volunteering at a local soup kitchen you can help provide much needed help for the less fortunate around the 
world by contributing to a world-wide non-profit organization.</p>

<p>
This is not a guide on where to go to figure out how to find projects, it is a step by step guide on getting set up, where 
and how to find the project that is best for you, once you find the right project it shows how to find and complete tasks, 
and then submit those contributions.

	</ul>
</span>

<span id="projects">
<h2>Finding the Right Project and Tasks</h2>
	In the world of Open Source there are a lot of projects to choose from, some being bigger or more complex than others, here are a few suggestions:</p>
	<ul>
	<li> <a HREF="Sahana_Eden/SahanaEden.html">Sahana Eden</a>- larger project with a good amount of outside 
	libraries which can get confusing, tasks are very easy to find in the code</li>
	<li> <a HREF="Mifos/Mifos.html">Mifos X</a>- larger project that requires a reasonable amount of knowledge about financial terms</li>
	<li> <a HREF="OpenStack/OpenStack.html">OpenStack</a>- medium sized project with a slightly more complex work flow </li>
	<li> <a HREF="http://openhatch.org/search/" target = "_blank">OpenHatch</a>- database of countless Open Source projects, search by language, 
	project, and difficulty</li>
	</ul>
</span>

<span id="submitting">
<h2>Submitting Changes</h2>
After you have fixed an issue it is time to submit your changes to the project. Every project has a different way of taking
submissions, this is called the workflow. Some workflows are more complex than others. 
	<ul>
	<li> <a HREF="Sahana_Eden/SahanaEden.html#submittingChanges">Sahana Eden</a>
	<li> <a HREF="Mifos/Mifos.html#submittingChanges">Mifos X</a>
	<li> <a HREF="OpenStack/OpenStack.html#submittingChanges">OpenStack</a>
